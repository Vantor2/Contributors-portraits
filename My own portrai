            <p class="card-text">So, why did I choosed to start programming? There is no heroic answer to this question. It kinda just happend.
            I started simple programming in the school with using delphi, HTML4 and CSS3. I installed lately the app SoloLearn and got into it again.
            A big help was freecodecamp.com and khanacademy.com too. I am still a beginner and have not much experience with the style of programming
            and/or using GitHub as a platform - but I hope that this event will teach me how to interact with OpenScource platforms so there will be
            longtime motivation and maybe help some others with their code too. :)
